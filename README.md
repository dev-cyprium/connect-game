# About
Connect-game is a game development project implemented in a web stack that is my second 
gamer related project for the web. ( the first one being MineHunter )
It features a puzzle game where the point is to fill the grid with elements.

It uses:
 - Node as a static server for testing
 - JavaScript for the code implementation using the javascript library CreateJS
